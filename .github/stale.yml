  It's been roughly 90 days since opening this issue. We apologize if we haven’t gotten back to 
  you—research openings are somewhat sporadic, so sometimes we don’t have specific opportunities to offer. 
  But more will certainly come in the future! If you're still interested
  in doing research with us, please respond with "Still interested for <semester/summer>".
  Additionally, please update the issue by editing it and supplying us with more information,
  an updated resumé, etc. If you're no longer interested, do not respond to this thread and we will automatically
  close this issue.
